# FitBit_Tracker_Python
This repository contains Python scripts and Colab notebook for analyzing a fitness tracker dataset. The dataset includes various parameters such as steps taken, distance covered, calories burned, heart rate, and more, collected from a fitness tracking device.

Dataset Description:
The dataset consists of records collected over a specific period, typically capturing daily activities of individuals. Each record contains multiple attributes related to fitness activities, including but not limited to steps taken, distance traveled, calories burned, active minutes, and heart rate.

Usage:
Data Preprocessing: Open and run data_preprocessing.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook to clean the dataset, handle missing values, and perform any necessary preprocessing steps.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Execute exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb to explore and visualize the dataset, identifying trends, patterns, and correlations among different features.
